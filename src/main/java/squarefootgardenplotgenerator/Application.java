    /*
    ##### KNOWN BUGS #####
    SOLVED! *If the gardener goes through the entire list of plants to add and adds no plants at all, or adds less than the total
             number of squares in the grid, GridMaker will fail and no grid will be produced.
                 >> Solution?: Add an empty grid type to the possible squares and automatically
                     add all empties to the map if the numTotalPlants does not equal totalSquares.
                     Can add this as a "default" type in the map. Also maybe remove it from
                     consideration in the sorting of the queue.
